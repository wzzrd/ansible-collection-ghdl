role is called 

role checks whether binary is already installed (install location + binary name - do we know binary name??)
downloader_binary_name can be optional and default to github_project

if binary is installed, check version with version_command

if it is not installed binary_version will be 'none'
if it is installed, binary_version will be the output of the version_command

if downloader_version is set, it then compares the binary_version to the downloader_version
if downloader_version is not set - we assume latest then - it:
    fetches the latest version from the github api
    extracts the version from that
    sets downloader_version to that
    makes the comparison anyway

if the output of the above is "different", we continue, else, we stop here

"different" so we need to download

extract the downloader_url from the api output (might do that above already, is small task)
download the payload

if archive 
unarchive, copy to location (downloader_install_location) + set owner + mode

if binary
copy to location (downloader_install_location) + set owner + mode

remove temporary files (optional for idempotency)


variables:
org
project 
binary_name (optional)
downloader_version (optional)
downloader_install_dir (defaults to /usr/local/bin)
downloader_owner (defaults to root)
downloader_group (defaults to root)
downloader_mode (defaults to 0755)

matchers can be overridden
    prefer musl over glibc
